.Sh DESCRIPTION
Wiimix is a fork of the Dolphin emulator designed for shuffling games.
It is currently under development, but intends to extend dolphin to cache multiple games at a time
and switch between them and certain save states for each game. This core functionality will be combined 
with functionality such as game specific objectives and a save state database to implement systems such as 
objective-based randomizers and bingo boards/lockouts, as well as to allow for customizing your own personal wiimix!
