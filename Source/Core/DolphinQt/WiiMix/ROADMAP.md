# Roadmap

> Currently just using this to keep a list of things that we would like to implement at some point

[] - Save State Compression
[] - Player table (track objective completion, success stats, victory stats, etc) and auth
[] - Time Attack Bingo Mode
[] - Support multiple devices for hotkeys so you can play with controller but also have a reset button while maintaining all of your other hotkeys
[] - Figure out access; DB API? Does the server REALLY need to be a PRIVATE submodule if everything's abstracted already?
[] - Since we only need exception handling for the server, can we enable it exclusively for that build target?
[] - Database snapshots (for recovery/backup)
[] - Tests!
[] - Optimize pulling objectives or waiting screen or something
[] - Build in a UI in account window for objective history
[] - Polish player account windows (i.e. support for profile pics)
[] - Leaderboard on the WiiMix website
