#### WiiMix [ˈwiː.mɪks]:

> 1. To rediscover the Wii and earlier console generations by shuffling games and states for an unpredictable, exciting experience
> 2. A fork of the incredible [Dolphin Emulator](https://dolphin-emu.org) that adds new modes revolving around the concept of objectives: challenges that combine save states and [Retroachievements](https://retroachievements.org/)

⚠️ WiiMix does NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORT WII GAMES, as Retroachievements does not currently support Wii games; if you would like WiiMix to support Wii games, we recommend you check out the [Retroachievements Developer Guide](https://docs.retroachievements.org/developer-docs/getting-started-as-an-achievement-developer.html) and contribute to the Retroachievements project ⚠️

By combining objectives with extra functionality such as game swapping, WiiMix tests your ability to adapt and your knowledge of [supported games](https://wiimake.github.io/static-site/)

## Modes

- Bingo: travel across games and states to be the first to complete a bingo board of achievements
- Shuffle: swap between games with randomized time intervals in between
- Roguelike: the console has gone rogue! Can you complete a series of achievements while the console attempts to stop you?

## Contributing

The project is still in it's early stages. As such, we appreciate any help that you can provide, whether it's documenting a bug on the [Issues](https://github.com/WiiMake/WiiMix/issues) tab, [creating objectives](#creating-objectives), or [adding new features/fixing bugs in line with our contribution guidelines](https://github.com/WiiMake/WiiMix/blob/master/Contributing.md). If you are contributing or using the project, please follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/WiiMake/WiiMix/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md); we follow the exact same policies as Dolphin Emulator and encourage people to be respectful and make positive contributions to our efforts to relive our favorite games and experience hidden gems through WiiMix.

### Creating Objectives

TODO: finish documenting this once this system is finished. Use pics.

PLEASE before you upload an objective, make sure the objective DOES NOT ALREADY EXIST!
